Fraud Fraud As your One Customer Bank, we are investing in high-level security measures to reduce the rate of fraudulent activities and ensure that your details and transactions are safe at all times. The Real Superhero! Despite all the fancy security steps we\'ve taken to keep scammers at bay, guess what? The real superhero in this battle against online fraud is none other than YOU! Everything’s changed these days, right? From farming to learning to staying healthy, we’re doing it all differently – thanks to some pretty cool advances in tech.Banking’s keeping up with the times too. Now we can shop, pay bills, invest, and do a ton of other stuff online, all from the cosy corners of our homes, with just our smartphones or laptops in hand.But, hold up, there’s a big ol’ dark cloud looming over this shiny digital world: cybercrime. Yep, it’s a real buzzkill. Hackers – those folks who are a bit too clever with technology for the wrong reasons – are messing with the convenience of mobile banking, big time.So, to keep your digital dough safe and sound, here’s a rundown of 5 simple things you definitely wanna do to steer clear of online scammers: 1. Do not reply phone calls, e-mails and texts requesting for your Banking details If you have a Sterling Bank account, we will never request for your Password, OTP or PIN via email, text message or phone calls. If you are yet to open an account, our agents will call you to explain our offerings. However, please do not reply to text messages and emails from unknown individuals requesting for your card details or the One Time Password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number. Always verify the source of such requests as we will never send you a text, call or email requesting for your Password, OTP, PIN. Also note that Sterling is NOT distributing covid-19 relief money to its customers. 2. Always keep your BVN and card details safe: Never share your Bank Verification Number (BVN) and card PIN with anyone that’s not you. In the event that your ATM card gets misplaced or stolen, please contact our One Customer Centre on 070078375464 or send an email to [email protected] immediately to report the incidence and block your card. 3. Check your account activity regularly We’ve made it easy to do this by sending your account’s e-statement on a monthly basis to your e-mail and also providing a statement of account view on Onepay, our Omni-channel banking app. Please check your account statement regularly and report any anomaly noticed immediately to Customer Care or your relationship manager. 4. Change your password regularly One good way to ensure your details are not compromised is to make sure you change your password regularly. It is also important that your password is strong enough to prevent any form of hacking. Strong passwords make it difficult for anyone to figure out your details and access the funds in your account. A strong password should contain at least six characters (a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters), numbers and symbols. The more characters, the stronger the password. Example of a strong password-Demand03@FireWire20. 5. Watch your surroundings when making withdrawals on the ATM When approaching an ATM, pay attention to your surroundings and make sure no one is lurking around to steal your PIN and also find out how much money is in your account. Make use of ATMs you are familiar with and observe the machines for damages before slotting your ATM card in as it could have been tampered with by fraudsters.For more information, please contact our One Customer Centre on 07008220000 or send an email to [email protected]. We would love to hear from you and provide required solution that will satisfy you. Our official social media handles: Our Official Instagram handle: @sterlingbankOur Official Twitter handle: @Sterling_BankngOur Official Youtube handle: Sterling BankNgOur SMS sender’s ID: STERLING & STERLING NG.For more information, please contact our One Customer Centre on 070078375464 or send an email to [email protected]. We would love to hear from you and provide required solution that will satisfy you. Frequently Asked Questions Why is my transaction taking a while to process? This could happen when your transaction is being reviewed. Please give it a little more time. Also, look out for a call from 070008220000 or an email alert from ********@sterling.ng Why was my transfer under review? Your security is our number one priority. If we observe any unusual activity, your transaction may be reviewed. This is to prevent impersonation and verify that you initiated the transfer.Also, we are compelled by global regulatory compliance to gather additional information about money transfers. This might cause a slight delay in your transfer process but it’s vital in protecting you and meeting legal requirements. Why was my transfer declined? Transfers may be declined if we observe unusual activity and cannot confirm the transaction was initiated by the owner of the account.For instance, transfers could be declined when:a. The customer is not able to pick up the confirmation call.b. The customer picks up but is silent and refuses to say a word.If any of these instances occur, a total restriction will be placed on the account. This restriction will only be lifted if the customer visits a branch or calls the One Customer Centre on 07008220000 How do I cancel a suspicious transfer from my account? Call the Fraud Desk or One Customer Centre on any of the following numbers:07008220000+234(0)129317960700STERLING070078375464014484481-5Or dial *822*911# to block your account from any available device. What happens when unusual activity is detected on my account? Your transfers/accounts are likely to be suspended if unusual activity is detected. When our systems pick any transaction out of the ordinary, we carry out a review in order to keep your account safe from fraud. Our policy is to make sure your money is always protected. Why am I being asked to confirm my transaction? One of our best tools in keeping your transactions secure is making sure everyone is accounted for, so we may reach out to collect information from you. We also want to empower you to follow transaction best practices that keep your account safe. The information you provide will help us do just that. How long does the confirmation call take? Once you have successfully satisfied our enquiry, it usually takes less than 5 minutes. What will happen to my transaction if I don’t take the call? If we can’t confirm the transaction was initiated by you, it will be declined, and your home branch will be notified. They would then contact you by either a phone call or paying a visit to your registered address. What do I do if I lost my mobile device? Sterling Bank incorporates the convenience you want with industry-leading safety and security features that provide peace of mind. In addition to the steps we take to protect you, there are a few steps you should take, too. If you have lost your smartphone or mobile device, take these steps immediately: Dial *822*911# to block your account from any available device. Alert Sterling Bank (and any other financial institution you access using your device). Change any usernames and passwords that may have been stored on your mobile device. If you’re using any cloud-based services, sign into them and disable remote access and alerts for any mobile apps you have linked to your missing phone or device. File a police report, if necessary. Alert your mobile carrier.

We extended our waste management partnership initiative to additional states making it 28 states with which we have partnered on waste managementWe commenced partnership with African Clean Up initiative in the drive to turn waste to wealth using waste to pay for the school fees of less privileged Nigerians in a pilot programme Environmental Sustainability Waste Management Partnerships We have partnered with the Lagos State Waste Management Agency (LAWMA) for over a decade to promote environmental sustainability. We worked with the laudable institution to keep Africa’s largest metropolis clean and healthy. While the demands of keeping the city clean have increased due to its reputation as being one of the world’s fastest-growing cities, we remain committed to this partnership and see it as a joint responsibility. Over 100,000 uniforms have been provided for the street sweepers based on this partnership.As part of the partnership investment, we also invested in the LAWMA awards ceremony where outstanding workers are celebrated and rewarded. This helps to boost the morale of the men and women who daily bear the brunt of the enormous waste created across the city every day.Beyond Lagos, we have extended this partnership across the country to 27 additional states to promote cleanliness and healthy living across Africa’s giant. This is in line with our focus on expanding impact across the country. The additional waste management partner states include – Sokoto, Bauchi, Gombe, Maiduguri, Abia, Kano, Osun, Kaduna, Rivers, Kwara, Delta, Oyo, Abuja, Ekiti, Ogun, Enugu, Anambra, Benue, Edo, Niger, Kogi, Kaduna, Akwa Ibom, Cross-river, Imo, Ondo, Plateau and Lagos states. The partnership involved kitting out of over 50,000 street sweepers across the country. This brings the total number of our partner states to 28. Our target is to take this laudable investment to every state in the country.Street sweepers kitted by Sterling Bank Sterling Environmental Makeover Employee volunteering is one of our priorities for staff engagement and this was extended to the Sterling Environmental Makeover (#STEM) initiative, an investment the Bank’s staff have made for over 6 years. The Bank’s executive and senior management including all staff join the relevant agencies to clean several streets and marketplaces across the country. It is one of several initiatives the Bank has embarked on to promote environmental sustainability in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative has since become a movement currently attracting corporates and celebrities who intend to be part of this good cause. In 2019, it was executed during the World Clean Up day (WCD) and International Coastal Cleanup Day (ICCD), on September 21, 2019 in 22 states of the country concurrently. The World Clean Up Day is an annual global social action program aimed at combating the global solid waste problem, including the problem of marine debris. In Lagos, the team executed both a street cleaning and beach clean-up exercise with various corporate organizations and individuals including GreenHub Africa, Dupont, Clickatell, Heritage Place, Tek Experts, Bolt, Dispose Recyclers, and the Beach Restoration Project. Past partners include the British Council, LasGidi Recyclers, Megalectric, L’oreal, Daar communications, Malta Guiness, Indomie Noodles, KPMG, MTV Base, Pepsi and Wecyclers. Also, partnered with Recycles Pay to turn Waste to Wealth. Recyclables picked at several events/locations were sold and the proceeds were used to finance the education of some children namely Destiny Mebi, Godwill Oroboshiri and Nado. The children and their families live in the Ajegunle area of Lagos state. This helped ease the burden of paying for their education while availing them the opportunity of a better future.Business Executive, Mr Godwin Ibeabuchi and the founder of LasGidi Recyclers Ms. Idu Okwuosa at a street cleaning exercise at Freedom Way, Lekki, Lagos Recyclart Competition We launched Recyclart competition where recyclable materials are used in creating sculptures and art works. The competition serves to preserve culture by empowering young artists and emerging talent nationally. Participants were required to create an original piece of art made from recycled and repurposed materials to be exhibited at a public space. The competition took place in four zones – Lagos, Ogun, Rivers and Abuja. A cash prize of One Million Naira and several other benefits in kind were awarded to each winner from the four zones.Sterling Bank Recyclart competition winnersThe Vice president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo at the display of the Recyclart artworks with the MD, Sterling Bank at the African Culture & Design Festival art exhibition themed ‘This is Africa’Mr Adegboyega Adegun, Business Executive, Corporate Banking, presenting the One Million Naira cheques to winners of the Sterling Bank Recyclart competition Waste Recycling Initiative We employed sustainable waste management practices in both the Head Office and Annex offices. This is one of the measures put in place to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, by adopting the principle of “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.” In partnership with Wecyclers and LAWMA, we commenced a Waste Recycling Initiative with the aim of managing the bank’s waste in an orderly manner thereby reducing the Bank’s carbon footprint. The initiative enables dispose its waste by separating bio-degradable waste from recyclable waste. LAWMA disposes the bio-degradable waste while the recyclable (Paper, Cans, Sachet, Pet etc.) are further processed from waste to wealth, creating additional employment for small and medium entrepreneurs and access to income generation opportunities for the SMEs. We are one of the first financial institutions in Nigeria to adopt a sustainable approach to waste management in partnership with LAWMA and Wecyclers Ltd and have commenced extending the waste recycling initiative to branches. Tree planting To address the challenge of desertification in the North-eastern parts of the country, we launched a tree planting exercise in three states: Bauchi, Gombe and Plateau states. Over 600 trees were planted in this initial phase of afforestation. An ambitious target has been set to plan one million trees around the country. We commemorated the World Environment Day with an Adopt-A-Plant initiative where all staff members were encouraged to adopt plants. Energy saving Initiatives At Sterling, we are constantly evaluating how to evolve our processes to serve our customers better without expanding our carbon footprint. The natural outcome from this ongoing improvement cycle is finding how to use resources more efficiently. As such, we have been proactive in addressing climate change issues in our business operations. Following a detailed audit of resource utilization in our business operations, we have executed various initiatives including process automation project roll-out that limits paper usage, use of video conference facilities, with attendant reduction in travel costs and fossil fuel consumption, use of energy saving bulbs at most of our locations and solar powered ATMs and perimeter lighting solutions at over 80percent of our locations. We remain committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions because of our operations and have over 50 percent of our locations powered by hybrid or off-grid solar solutions. We also prioritize Environmental and Social Risk assessment as part of our risk assessment process, which guide investment decision-making at the Bank. GRI Reporting and Sustainability Report Our Sustainability reports have been prepared in accordance the Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBPs) which provides a standardized framework that guides our actions towards sustainable business practices and also with the GRI standards.

Yes. Solar solutions are globally proven to be more cost efficient than traditional forms of power generation (grid and carbon powered generators) in the medium and long term.

Customers can access the solution through the following: Outright payment: Customers on the platform have the option to pay the full amount of any solution using the available payment gateways. Lease to own: This offering enables customers who cannot pay outrightly for the solution to spread the payment over a period as long as 24 months. Power as a Service (PaaS)*: This is an alternative to the lease to own offering, where the customers pay for constant electricity supply at an agreed fee without owning the asset. The subscriber is charged a flat monthly fee. (*terms and conditions apply.) What if I don’t know how much energy I use? You can request for a quote that details the cost, capacity, and appliances you can use on each system. Kindly contact us on phone or via email. I have plans for expansion. Can I plan for now? We frequently consider future growth plans when designing your system. The choice of inverter can be influenced by near-term expectations about power usage and in some cases, it may be best to include excess capacity now and simply add more modules later. We are available to discuss your plans for energy usage and explore a variety of options to meet your needs now and in the future. Will my roof be able to bear the load of the Solar PV systems? A thorough structural analysis is done by our team to determine if your roof’s load bearing capacity is sufficient to take the load of the solar PV modules. Concrete roofs have no problems at all in handling the distributed load nature of solar PV modules, however, T-slabs, asbestos & truss-based roofs have to be analysed first before they are used for installation. Are there any running costs associated with renewable solution? None. Once your system is installed, electricity production is completely free. There are no ongoing running costs. How long do the batteries last for? Battery life may vary according to the solution provided and subject to usage. Information on each battery life is provided in the product details. How long does the inverter last for? Inverter life may vary according to the solution provided and subject to usage. Information on each inverter life is provided in the product details. What is the difference between my electricity usage and my electricity load? Electricity usage is the number of units of electricity that you use each day and is measured in kilowatt-hours (Kwh). Electricity load is the amount of energy that is required to run all the electrical appliances you use simultaneously. What happens when you default on your loan? You will be contacted and reminded of past due obligation on the first event of default. Any subsequent default would result in a recovery of the solution. Is there any cost apart from the solution cost? Yes, the cost of installation will be paid upfront by the user. When is the payment due date? The payment date is the last day of every month. What happens if my solution is faulty? Customers are eligible to after-sales services. While after–sales services are free for some solutions, some others may warrant that customers pay a fee Can I secure financing to upgrade my renewable solution? Yes.

Head of Market & Liquidity Risk Management. Prior to this role, I had many others within the Bank. Why Sterling? Can you recall the moment that ignited your passion to join Sterling? Exploring Sterling’s rich history and seeing how it had evolved over 50 years (at the time) was inspiring. From my initial contact with Sterling Humans about a graduate trainee test to my first day at the training school, the interactions were truly amazing. So, I told myself, we might be able to build something here – let’s see! Reflecting on your departure, what motivated you to explore new horizons? I embarked on a new adventure by moving to a different country and spending more time with my family. Even though I left behind the familiar, I’ll always be a Sterling Human at heart. Thanks to the foundation that Sterling gave me, which fueled my ambition to discover new paths. Exploring new horizons has been a very rewarding experience for my career, and I appreciate the doors it has opened for me. How did your time here shape your career trajectory? In my 10 years at Sterling, I had the privilege to work across various functions, assignments, and teams, which has helped me grow my business acumen and work ethic.

Sterling ‘Listens’. At Sterling, everyone’s voice is heard, regardless of their background or age. The company culture encourages boldness and openness, making it easy for employees to speak out and share their ideas. I cherish my time at Sterling, especially when I emerged as the best-graduating student in the first set of the Sterling Graduate Associate (SGAP) Program in 2012 (A unique talent leadership development program). This experience motivated me to always bring my best self to work and perform at my highest potential. What advice would you give to other Ex-Sterling Humans who are contemplating a comeback and to aspiring Sterling Humans? What makes Sterling a Home for all? Building a strong reputation early in your career is crucial because someone is always watching whether it’s someone from within your company or someone externally. It’s also important to take responsibility for your career development by seeking out the types of job experiences you want, pursuing formal learning opportunities that will support your goals, and building relationships with colleagues through employee resource groups or professional associations. Finally, connecting with mentors and sponsors is a vital step towards success. While luck can play a role, it’s up to you to open doors and cultivate growth opportunities.

I missed the leadership style here too where leaders walk the talk and are actively responsive to the employees’ needs. I particularly missed the part where Sterling leaders are drivers of change and very receptive to innovations. Sterling EVPs are second to none in the industry.

H.E.A.R.T H.E.A.R.T Lending tailored for HEART sectors. (Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy and Transportation) H.E.A.R.T Benefits Growth in the economy will call for more specialized and complex financial services which will lead to growth in other financial services outside of commercial banking. More so, the growth of emerging market economies will enable financial service providers (especially banks) within those environments to gain strength and provide the impetus for expansion beyond their borders. This enables them to spread risks in time of volatility. Given this background, Sterling Bank intends to be the financial institution of choice for key stakeholders by enhancing technological capability and entrenching a customer-centric business model. Health Sector Given the increasing demand for healthcare services and the inadequacy of Government’s intervention in the sector, private sector participation has been on the rise across the entire value chain of the sector. Consequently, greater emphasis is placed on the growing private healthcare market, which makes it a focal point for prospective investors to examine. Learn More Our goal in the sector is to:• Improve healthcare delivery infrastructure through Equipment Financing.• Improve access to medical technology that also improves health business by providing access andinformation to practitioners in the sector. These will include technologies such as Hospital Management systems to improve data collection, analysis and decision making, and Inventory Management system to keep track of stock.• Increase technical capacity across the sector through Capacity Building/Trainings.• Encourage innovative cost-effective business models through our partnerships with other experts. Education Sector Nigeria has one of the highest numbers of out of school children, one of the lowest budgets by the government for education and a large youth population- all three issues providing both a crisis and a blessing. For us, given the realization that the government alone cannot cater to the large need of the population provides us with an opportunity. Learn More By providing access and content we are aiming to:• Deepen the knowledge of students, teachers, and school business owners• Improve education infrastructure• Improve the number of enrolled children per year.• Provide access to finance for parents, schools and other stakeholders. We will go a step further to fundunapproved schools to enable them to meet the criteria for approvals from the government• Invest in technology that enables easy learning and dissemination of information to students and teachers• Seek strategic partnerships outside of Nigeria to enable foreign investment flows into the education sector Renewable Energy Sector Nigeria in its history of electricity generation has not had adequate supply of electricity thus leaving it behind on various innovation in the globalized world. As the country’s economy develops further, the demand for energy will increase. Already, the lack of adequate power supply cripples’ industries and slows industrialization. Globally, the gradual diminishing of fossil fuels and the efforts to save the eco-system from global warming has seen nations turning to alternative sources to meet their energy demands. Learn More Nigeria is not left behind as the adoption of alternative sources of energy will accentuate existing supply capabilities from on-grid power sources, boost growth further and reduce environmental pollution. Our play in the renewable space is part of our commitment to growing and improving businesses in Nigeria by reducing their cost of power while ensuring constant supply. We have taken a 3-pronged approach to achieving this:• Trading- we intend to create a platform that enables the sale of renewable energy solutions between electricity generators, distributors and users.• Financing- large projects that provide electricity to communities and businesses.• Creating Partnerships to encourage the flow of foreign investments into the renewable space and bridge the service gaps which currently exist with the solutions. Agriculture Sector ‘Feeding the Nation is everyone’s responsibility’. This is the mantra that guides our actions in the Agriculture sector Learn More We believe that Nigeria’s industrialization and poverty reduction will come from the sector that currently provides the highest means of livelihood and thus we will:• Provide finance across the value chain for agriculture to ensure that clean food reaches the table of Nigerians, Agriculture industrialists are wealthy, and Farmers live a healthy and fulfilling life.• Provide a platform that links all players within the industry while providing information to help improve their business Transportation Sector In many developing countries, the transportation sector contributes between 6% to 14% of the GDP but contributes below 1.5% to Nigeria’s GDP. An efficient transport system optimizes the value chain in any economy and impacts on other sectors of the economy. The introduction of new technologies, new players and changing customer behaviors provide the sector with the potential to transform as a system and for new business models to develop. Learn More This provides an opportunity for us to bridge the gap that challenges such as poor infrastructure, lack of investment and development of new technologies and poor mass transit creates. For the transportation sector, we will:• Invest in technologies that ensure efficient collections for transport businesses.• Provide financing that enables transport businesses to scale up from their current models.• Create partnerships with experts outside of Nigeria to test new business models that ensure that economic resources are adequate, properly and safely transported.• Actively encourage the use of mass transit systems to reduce carbon emissions in line with our commitment to a cleaner environment Corporate MSME Payments Loans Personal Banking Savings Current Investment Loans Cards E-Channels Business Banking Corporates SME Services Payments Loans H.E.A.R.T Alternative Banking SAF Private Banking Invest Now Edubanc Agriculture About Us Who we are Awards Board of Directors Executive Management Our Policy Investors Careers Help & Support Feedback Contact us Whistleblowing ATM Locator Agent Banking Complaints Forms Self Certification Copyright © 2024, Sterling Bank Ltd.

Downloads Notice of Meeting Scheme of Arrangement Downloads Notice of Meeting Scheme of Arrangement Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Proposed Transaction? Sterling Bank PLC (“Sterling Bank” or the “Bank”) is transitioning to a holding company through a Scheme of Arrangement between the Bank and its Shareholders (the “Scheme” or “Proposed Transaction”). The Proposed Transaction will provide for the creation of a new non-operating holding company named Sterling Financial Holdings Company Limited (the “HoldCo”), which will wholly own Sterling Bank and the non-interest bank (“The Alternative Bank Limited”). Why is Sterling Bank converting to a holding company? Sterling Bank is converting to a holding company to allow its shareholders to maintain continued exposure to the Bank’s existing lines of business and gain exposure to new permissible business lines that would enhance stakeholders’ value, by providing the Bank with the flexibility to pursue such opportunities and diversify.The Bank intends to spin-off its non-interest banking business which currently operates as a window of the Bank. However, under the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (“CBN”) regulations, the Bank’s current structure limits its ability to do this. The holding company structure will facilitate a consolidated financial strength of the group and provide the subsidiaries access to group-wide expertise of the parent company model; it will also allow the Bank to position itself for growth within the fast-evolving financial services industry. How will the Proposed Transaction be implemented? The Proposed Transaction entails the creation of the new HoldCo, which will hold the shares of Sterling Bank PLC once the Scheme is approved by shareholders and sanctioned by the Federal High Court (the “Court”). HoldCo will also hold the shares of the The Alternative Bank Limited, which will house the assets, liabilities, and undertakings of the non-interest banking business currently within Sterling Bank PLC: Will shareholders have a say in the Proposed Transaction? The Bank’s shareholders will be entitled to consider and approve the Proposed Transaction at a Court Ordered Meeting (“COM”), scheduled to hold on the 19th of September 2022. At the COM, the shareholders will vote on the resolutions to effect the Scheme / Proposed Transaction. The Scheme is to be approved, with or without modification(s), by a resolution of a majority representing three-quarters (¾) in value of the shares held by the Bank’s shareholders present and voting either in person or by proxy at the COM When and where will the meeting be held? The meeting / COM will hold at 10.00 am on Monday, 19th of September 2022 at Shell Hall, Muson Centre, Onikan Lagos, Nigeria. In the interest of public safety and having due regard to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) COVID-19 Guidance for Safe Mass Gatherings in Nigeria, only the Selected Proxies listed in the Scheme document and on the Proxy Form would be allowed to attend the COM physically. All other shareholders would be required to attend the COM virtually via www.sterling.ng/meeting and to vote through a proxy. The Proxy Form and Selected Proxies can be found on page 58 of the Scheme document. What will happen if shareholders approve the Scheme? Sterling Bank will seek the formal approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the sanction of the Court, to make the Scheme effective.Sterling Bank will subsequently apply to have its shares delisted from Nigerian Exchange Limited (“NGX”) and in its place, the HoldCo Shares will be listed thereon. Shareholders will exchange their shares in Sterling Bank for shares in HoldCo in the same proportion as their current holdings in the Bank. Sterling Bank PLC will be converted to a private company – Sterling Bank Limited, which will become a subsidiary of HoldCo. Will shareholders be given cash consideration for their shares? No, Shareholders will not receive cash.The Proposed Transaction is a share-for-share exchange, where shareholders will exchange their shares in Sterling Bank for shares in HoldCo, in the same proportion as their current holdings in the Bank. The Proposed Transaction will not result in any adverse changes to the rights and ownership of existing shareholders of Sterling Bank. Which entity will be listed on the NGX under the Proposed Transaction? The newly created non-operating holding company called Sterling Financial Holdings Company Limited (which will be converted to a PLC upon the Scheme becoming effective) will be listed on the NGX, whilst Sterling Bank PLC will be delisted. What will be the value of the shares in HoldCo? HoldCo shares will be listed at the same price as the last trading price of the shares of Sterling Bank Plc on the day they are delisted from NGX. What will happen to current customers of Sterling Bank? The Bank’s non-interest banking customers will be moved to The Alternative Bank Limited, which will be held as a subsidiary of HoldCo. Whilst the remaining customers of Sterling Bank PLC will be housed under Sterling Bank Limited, which will also be a subsidiary of HoldCo. What will happen to current employees of Sterling Bank? Upon the completion of the Scheme, all employees of Sterling Bank will have opportunities within HoldCo’s businesses.Employees of the non-interest banking business will be redeployed to become employees of The Alternative Bank Limited. What will be the composition of the board and management of the restructured entities? Many of the current directors of Sterling Bank PLC will continue to be directors of Sterling Bank Limited.

Following that, he now owes N45,000 (N50,000 – N5,000) and a 2.5% Interest on this N45,000 = N1,125 bringing his outstanding to N46,125.*John must make at least 10% so as not to charge a late repayment fee.

Merchants receive settlement into their bank account the next working day. Acceptance Options How do I give my employees the option to accept SterlingQR when the app is on my phone? You can give permission to other people within your business to accept payment transactions through SterlingQR. These employees (as permitted and identified by you) can download the merchant app and log in using their ID and password. To enable this option, please contact the bank. My business needs are different. Are there other ways that I can accept SterlingQR? There are other convenient options to accept payment through SterlingQR:Generation of QR code: The QR code included in the SterlingQR merchant information display provided to you is “static.” This static QR code can be displayed at the payment counter, on an ID card or printed on a bill or receipt. It is also possible to generate a unique/dynamic QR code for every transaction. This “dynamic” QR code can be generated and displayed on your merchant app, on a point-of-sale machine, on a computer screen or even printed on bill or invoice. The “dynamic” QR code carries more information, including the invoice number and amount to be paid; hence the customer does not have to manually enter this data.Linkage with notification device: Each SterlingQR merchant ID is linked to a notification device like the merchant mobile app. However, it is also possible to have variations. For example:A notification for any one SterlingQR merchant ID (and QR code) can be linked and delivered to a mobile app on multiple smartphones.Notifications for multiple SterlingQR merchant IDs (and QR codes) can be delivered to a single mobile app on one smartphone.Receipt of notification: The payment notification can be received on not just a mobile app, but also on a point-of-sale machine, in a billing system or in a cash register.Through a combination of the above, SterlingQR payment acceptance can be customized for the needs of your business. Can I accept SterlingQR payments remotely, e.g., for home delivery? Yes. As explained in question 12, the acceptance of SterlingQR payments can be enabled for home delivery as well. Your employees can carry the “static” QR code on an ID card or the “dynamic” QR code can be printed on the invoice. Alternately, your employees can generate the QR code on their merchant mobile app. The payment notification can be received both by the person making the delivery, as well as by you or your manager in a remote location. Other questions How safe is SterlingQR? All payments made through SterlingQR are digitally secured and encrypted in transmission which make it highly secure. In fact, every SterlingQR transaction requires authentication and approval by your customer before it can be initiated. Without this authentication, no payments are processed. Escalation Path For enquiries on QR related issues and resolution, kindly contact our one Contact Centre on 0700STERLING, (070078375464). You can also send an email to [email protected].

A request to pay the tuition fee of my child who is attending a primary school in the UK was declined even though my account was fully funded, and all relevant documents submitted; why?The official window can only be assessed for payment of fees for undergraduate and postgraduate programs subject to prescribed limits and appropriate documentation. This does not however preclude customers from making payments for other types of program from their ordinary domiciliary accounts Transfer directly to student account? Can school fees be transferred directly to the student’s account for further credit to the beneficiary institution?Only the living expenses component may be transferred directly tostudent’s account where it is separated on the invoice.

Form A may not be readily available when needed. Can I make photocopies of blank form A and keep for future use?No. Each form A has a unique application number which may not be reused for other transactions. Until the CBN launches e form A the same way they have done for Form M and Form NXP, customers can continue to approach any of our branches nationwide for their form A needs. Other currencies? Can payments be made in other currencies apart from USD/GBP/EUR?Yes. A cross rate will be obtained from Treasury to determine the currency equivalent. Sterling Bank will transfer the equivalent based on Treasury advised rate with an instruction for the paying bank to pay the beneficiary in the desired currency How will the bank handle the refund? My university admission lapsed after payment of initial deposit and the school has initiated a refund / return of funds. How will the bank handle the refund? The handling will depend on the source of funds. Funds purchased from the CBN must be repatriated to the CBN for repurchase and customer credited with Naira equivalent upon receipt of the same from the CBN. However, funds from other autonomous market will be repurchased by Treasury and customer credited with the Naira equivalent. Beneficiary receive less than transferred? Why does the beneficiary receive less than the amount transferred by the customer?The shortfalls are generally due to deduction of charges by the Offshore bank(s) Where a customer wants the beneficiary to receive the full amount transferred, they must state their willingness to bear offshore bank charges on the transfer instruction submitted to the bank. Why do school fees payment get processed faster? Why do school fees payment get processed faster than other invisible transactions?There is a special allocation from the CBN to cater for school feesand medical payment whereas payment for other invisibles depend on how quickly funds can be sourced from other official windows How do banks decide?

Funds from several windows Can Importers source funds from several windows to fund a Letter of Credit transaction?Customers can source funds from several windows including own ordinary domiciliary account and own export domiciliary account to fund eligible trade transaction. However, care must be taken to ensure allocated amount does not exceed transaction value to forestall loss that may arise from repurchase of excess allocation. What exchange rate will the bank use to convert the Naira to dollar? I am submitting relevant documentation for the bank to process a form A transaction from my Naira account. What exchange rate will the bank use to convert the Naira to dollar?Transaction will be processed using the prevailing exchange rate forthe product types. Financial assistance abroad?

Over 700,000 primary school pupils in 1,665 schools across 544 local government areas (LGAs) have been impacted since inception. Promoting literacy and education over the years has proven to be an effective approach to alleviating poverty and improving the well-being of the society. This initiative is an intervention in Nigeria’s education sector in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Four which focuses on ensuring inclusive quality education and learning opportunities for all. It is positioned to help in achieving equality and fostering sustainable development across Nigeria.

Parenting Workshop Amid the hustle and bustle of big city living, many parents feel overwhelmed by the demands of parenting. With 70% of our workforce having children under 16, we understand very well the issues many of our employees must deal with on the home front. Their success or not in that area can determine their productivity on the job. To address this challenge, we partnered with the Caleb Group of Schools to execute the first ever Parenting Workshop series as we saw its benefits immediately. The Workshop had two aims: to help parents and guardians deal with topical issues that affect the upbringing of their wards in the 21st century and maximize the potential of their wards. These issues are treated vis-à-vis the practical day-to-day realities of life in Nigeria.

Healthcare and Wellbeing Malaria Advocacy Project – Support for Anave Movie We partnered with the Malaria, Child, Maternal Mortality Eradication (MACMME) project to produce a movie titled ‘ANAVE’ in an effort to bring greater awareness to the plight of the less privileged Nigerian child and mother inflicted by the malaria scourge. The project was inspired by the statistics which showed that malaria is responsible for the death of an average of 300,000 children and 11 per cent of all maternal deaths each year in Nigeria. The MACMME project is an advocacy project which seeks to reduce the gruesome rates of maternal and child mortality attributable to preventable causes such as malaria, homelessness, hunger, and opportunistic diseases in Nigeria.

The vision of the MACMME project is to establish viable solutions for improved quality of life for the underprivileged Nigerian such as homeless shelters with access to basic healthcare, rehabilitation, and empowerment programmes. Partnership with Giving.ng for Healthcare Workers Healthcare professionals risk their lives while treating infected persons during the pandemic. In most of Nigeria, they earn just N5,000 (appr. $13) as hazard allowance. To support them, we partnered with the crowdfunding platform, Giving.ng to raise N1billion for the Health Workers Fund. The Health Workers Fund caters to the payment of hazard allowances for the health workers at the frontline taking care of patients infected with Coronavirus (COVID-19). The Bank seeded the Fund with N25million. It enables corporations, institutions and individuals in Nigeria and the diaspora support healthcare workers directly and reward them for their sacrifice and bravery. Covid-19 Drive-Through Testing Center We supported the country’s first COVID-19 drive-thru mass mobile testing center with an initial investment of N10million. This was done in partnership with Life Bank and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) to make testing easier and faster. This has reduced the burden of testing on the Nigerian Center of Disease Control (NCDC) and the risk of contagion of the disease due to ignorance of infected persons. The investment is planned to be scaled up as the project expands to different locations across the country. Investment in Health Infrastructure To strengthen public health infrastructure, we donated N50million for the equipping of the COVID-19 Isolation ward at the National Orthopedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos in partnership with Fate foundation philanthropy to cater to the increasing COVID-19 confirmed cases. We will continue scaling efforts to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic and promote a healthy society for the country. Affordable Healthcare for all Nigerians In the wake of the pandemic, we partnered with health startup, Tremendoc to provide free healthcare services to Nigerians across the country. Tremendoc, is a ‘phone-a-doctor’ app that helps you consult a physician for any ailment without leaving the comfort of your home. It was an investment for Nigerians to enable them practice social distancing with access to the best medical attention possible at their convenience. This was to reduce the risk of infections, the risk of death from the virus, especially for people with underlying health conditions and to limit fatalities during the pandemic from other diseases apart from the virus. COVID 19 Citizen Action Group Communication Campaign We executed a region-wide intensive awareness communication campaign to sensitize Nigerians in the North on the safety requirements to reduce the spread of the virus in the North in partnership with the Citizens Action Group.

Inclusion, Sustainable Economic Growth and Poverty Eradication Financial Inclusion We have taken a leadership position with reference to financial inclusion in the country. We have established our financial inclusion policy and are one of the foremost banks to launch the Agent Banking model targeted at the unbanked/under banked individuals. We launched the Sterling Agent Banking Edu-Finance Scheme to ease the burden of about 70 percent of Nigerians who receive wages weekly and are unable to make upfront payments of school fees on behalf of their children.

Creating a sustainable world Read More Our Sustainability Strategy As a socially and environmentally responsible Bank, we are committed to ensuring that sustainability is at the core of our business activities and operations.We have adopted a triple bottom line approach in our business activities and operations.We are committed to ensuring that sustainability is at the core of our strategy; we strive to ensure that environmental and social considerations are included in our strategic business decisions and these are implemented accordingly. This has been evident in our various Sustainability strategies and initiatives to enrich the lives of our stakeholders;EconomicWe have established a strategy targeted at impacting businesses within socially and environmentally conscious sectors – HEART (Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy, and Transportation) which is well-aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.We have also deployed sustainable and revolutionary products and services like I-Invest, Farepay, EveryNanny, Quickcash, and many more. EnvironmentOur mantra ‘committed to be nature’s keeper’ is a binding decision that has ensured we remain committed to identifying and mitigating the negative impacts of our business operations and activities on the immediate environment, thereby reducing our ecological footprint and committed to implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation actions to reduce emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases(GHGs).SocialWe are committed to enriching the lives of our stakeholders through the adoption of various employee welfare initiatives, Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, innovative products and services.Beyond this, the Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBPs) adopted by the bank provides a standardized framework that guides our actions towards sustainable business practices. We also adopt international best practices in the implementation of sustainability across our activities and operations such as products development, carbon footprint management, environment and social risk management, ﬁnancial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment, among others. Our HEART Sector Sustainable Investment Strategy Health Education Agriculture Renewable Energy Transportation The core of our business as a financial institution is the commitment to improving lives and encouraging economic development as well as sustainability.In 2017, We unveiled our HEART Sector (Health, Agriculture, Education and Transportation) Sustainable investment strategy; which focuses primarily on socially and environmentally conscious sectors which align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Health Our goal in this sector is to address – the inadequacy of medical technology and diagnostic infrastructure; little or no access to quality and affordable healthcare; and proliferation of fake pharmaceutical products. To achieve this, we will:•Improve healthcare delivery infrastructure through Equipment Financing• Improve access to medical technology that also improves health business by providing access and information to practitioners in the sector. These will include technologies such as Hospital Management Systems to improve data collection, analysis and decision making and Inventory Management system to keep track of stock• Create a platform for the pharmaceutical ecosystem, where all the stakeholders can interface seamlessly to curb counterfeiting. Education Our goal in this sector is to contribute significantly to the development of the sector by solving two critical problems – lack of access to education for the Nigerian child and the decadence of the quality of education in the country. To achieve this, we will: o Provide access to finance for parents, schools and other stakeholders. We will go a step further to fund unapproved schools to enable them to meet the criteria for approvals from the government• Invest in technology that enables easy learning and dissemination of information to students and teachers• Seek strategic partnerships outside of Nigeria to enable foreign investment flows into the education sector Agriculture ‘Feeding the Nation is everyone’s responsibility’. This is the mantra that guides our actions in the Agriculture sector. We believe that Nigeria’s industrialisation and poverty reduction will come from the sector that currently provides the highest means of livelihood and thus we will:• Provide finance across the value chain for agriculture to ensure that clean food reaches the table of Nigerians, Agriculture industrialists are wealthy, and Farmers live a healthy and fulfilling life• Provide a platform that links all players within the industry while providing information to help improve their business Renewable Energy Our goal in the sector is to tackle – the inadequacies of the on-grid power sources; and underfunding/under investment in the power sector. We have taken a 3-pronged approach to achieve this:• Trading- we intend to create a platform that enables the sale of renewable energy solutions between electricity generators, distributors and users.• Financing- large projects that provide electricity to communities and businesses• Creating Partnerships to encourage the flow of foreign investments into the renewable space and bridge the service gaps which currently exist with the solutions. Transportation We believe that an efficient transport system optimizes the value chain in any economy and impacts on other sectors of the economy. For the transportation sector, we are focused on bridging the following gaps;• Poor mass transit systems• Inefficient and lack of transparent collection systems underpinning lack of investment and development of new technologiesOur approach to solving these problems include:• Investing in technologies that ensure efficient collections for transport businesses• Providing financing that enables transport businesses scale up from their current models• Actively encouraging the use of mass transit systems to reduce carbon emissions in line with our commitment to a cleaner environment “ Our Sustainability Milestone 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 • We Established a Sustainable Banking Unit, under the Enterprise Risk Management Group to oversee the implementation of the Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles.• We developed a compendium of policies and frameworks to institutionalize the adoption of best-practice sustainability principles.• We commenced the Environmental and Social risk assessment of credit transactions. • We published our 1st Stand Alone Sustainability Report inline with GRI: G3 standards• We established an internal reporting portal to capture and analyze Sustainability metrics such as water, waste, energy consumption, paper usage etc.• We established partnership with a hybrid power outsourcing vendor to deploy this solution to several of our branches• Sustainability Capacity Building was included in the staff recruitment training and eLearning programs.• We commenced the computation of our Carbon footprint assessment. • We commenced the onsite Environmental & Social Risk Assessment of credit transactions.• We successfully adopted a Waste segregation and recycling initiative at our Head Office location - Sterling Towers.• We commenced our Uber for business service, thereby reducing our company fleet vehicles by 27%• We established a “Flexi-plan and Flexi-place” initiative for staff to enable them to achieve a desirable work-life balance. • We launched our ‘One Woman’ proposition in 2017 - an initiative focused on supporting women in business by granting them access to market and finance.• We established a Recyclart competition to further create awareness around waste management practices such as recycling and upcycling. • We commenced the implementation of paper consumption reduction strategies such as Print as A Service.• We implemented a medical insurance scheme for staff with leading Health Management Organisations (HMO) to enhance qualitative medic-care. • We commenced our H.E.A.R.T Sector sustainable investment strategy - a strategy targeted at impacting businesses within socially and environmentally conscious sectors - HEART (Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy, and Transportation) which is well-aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.• Successfully subscribed as a participatory member of the United Nations Global Compact - which focuses on Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption.• We commenced the recycling and responsible destruction of our Electronic wastes.
