Fraud Fraud As your One Customer Bank, we are investing in high-level security measures to reduce the rate of fraudulent activities and ensure that your details and transactions are safe at all times. The Real Superhero! Despite all the fancy security steps we've taken to keep scammers at bay, guess what? The real superhero in this battle against online fraud is none other than YOU! Everything’s changed these days, right? From farming to learning to staying healthy, we’re doing it all differently – thanks to some pretty cool advances in tech.Banking’s keeping up with the times too. Now we can shop, pay bills, invest, and do a ton of other stuff online, all from the cosy corners of our homes, with just our smartphones or laptops in hand.But, hold up, there’s a big ol’ dark cloud looming over this shiny digital world: cybercrime. Yep, it’s a real buzzkill. Hackers – those folks who are a bit too clever with technology for the wrong reasons – are messing with the convenience of mobile banking, big time.So, to keep your digital dough safe and sound, here’s a rundown of 5 simple things you definitely wanna do to steer clear of online scammers: 1. Do not reply phone calls, e-mails and texts requesting for your Banking details If you have a Sterling Bank account, we will never request for your Password, OTP or PIN via email, text message or phone calls. If you are yet to open an account, our agents will call you to explain our offerings. However, please do not reply to text messages and emails from unknown individuals requesting for your card details or the One Time Password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number. Always verify the source of such requests as we will never send you a text, call or email requesting for your Password, OTP, PIN. Also note that Sterling is NOT distributing covid-19 relief money to its customers. 2. Always keep your BVN and card details safe: Never share your Bank Verification Number (BVN) and card PIN with anyone that’s not you. In the event that your ATM card gets misplaced or stolen, please contact our One Customer Centre on 070078375464 or send an email to [email protected] immediately to report the incidence and block your card. 3. Check your account activity regularly We’ve made it easy to do this by sending your account’s e-statement on a monthly basis to your e-mail and also providing a statement of account view on Onepay, our Omni-channel banking app. Please check your account statement regularly and report any anomaly noticed immediately to Customer Care or your relationship manager. 4. Change your password regularly One good way to ensure your details are not compromised is to make sure you change your password regularly. It is also important that your password is strong enough to prevent any form of hacking. Strong passwords make it difficult for anyone to figure out your details and access the funds in your account. A strong password should contain at least six characters (a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters), numbers and symbols. The more characters, the stronger the password. Example of a strong password-Demand03@FireWire20. 5. Watch your surroundings when making withdrawals on the ATM When approaching an ATM, pay attention to your surroundings and make sure no one is lurking around to steal your PIN and also find out how much money is in your account. Make use of ATMs you are familiar with and observe the machines for damages before slotting your ATM card in as it could have been tampered with by fraudsters.For more information, please contact our One Customer Centre on 07008220000 or send an email to [email protected]. We would love to hear from you and provide required solution that will satisfy you. Our official social media handles: Our Official Instagram handle: @sterlingbankOur Official Twitter handle: @Sterling_BankngOur Official Youtube handle: Sterling BankNgOur SMS sender’s ID: STERLING & STERLING NG.For more information, please contact our One Customer Centre on 070078375464 or send an email to [email protected]. We would love to hear from you and provide required solution that will satisfy you. Frequently Asked Questions Why is my transaction taking a while to process? This could happen when your transaction is being reviewed. Please give it a little more time. Also, look out for a call from 070008220000 or an email alert from ********@sterling.ng Why was my transfer under review? Your security is our number one priority. If we observe any unusual activity, your transaction may be reviewed. This is to prevent impersonation and verify that you initiated the transfer.Also, we are compelled by global regulatory compliance to gather additional information about money transfers. This might cause a slight delay in your transfer process but it’s vital in protecting you and meeting legal requirements. Why was my transfer declined? Transfers may be declined if we observe unusual activity and cannot confirm the transaction was initiated by the owner of the account.For instance, transfers could be declined when:a. The customer is not able to pick up the confirmation call.b. The customer picks up but is silent and refuses to say a word.If any of these instances occur, a total restriction will be placed on the account. This restriction will only be lifted if the customer visits a branch or calls the One Customer Centre on 07008220000 How do I cancel a suspicious transfer from my account? Call the Fraud Desk or One Customer Centre on any of the following numbers:07008220000+234(0)129317960700STERLING070078375464014484481-5Or dial *822*911# to block your account from any available device. What happens when unusual activity is detected on my account? Your transfers/accounts are likely to be suspended if unusual activity is detected. When our systems pick any transaction out of the ordinary, we carry out a review in order to keep your account safe from fraud. Our policy is to make sure your money is always protected. Why am I being asked to confirm my transaction? One of our best tools in keeping your transactions secure is making sure everyone is accounted for, so we may reach out to collect information from you. We also want to empower you to follow transaction best practices that keep your account safe. The information you provide will help us do just that. How long does the confirmation call take? Once you have successfully satisfied our enquiry, it usually takes less than 5 minutes. What will happen to my transaction if I don’t take the call? If we can’t confirm the transaction was initiated by you, it will be declined, and your home branch will be notified. They would then contact you by either a phone call or paying a visit to your registered address. What do I do if I lost my mobile device? Sterling Bank incorporates the convenience you want with industry-leading safety and security features that provide peace of mind. In addition to the steps we take to protect you, there are a few steps you should take, too. If you have lost your smartphone or mobile device, take these steps immediately: Dial *822*911# to block your account from any available device. Alert Sterling Bank (and any other financial institution you access using your device). Change any usernames and passwords that may have been stored on your mobile device. If you’re using any cloud-based services, sign into them and disable remote access and alerts for any mobile apps you have linked to your missing phone or device. File a police report, if necessary. Alert your mobile carrier.
